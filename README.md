## Technologies Used

1. React
2. Styled components for CSS

## API used

1. Jikan API

### Unsolved Problems

1. Users are able to add the same anime to favourites twice - sort of solved as button can now be disabled. however, still thinking how to prevent button from being un-disabled on refresh
2. Only able to remove the first item on the favorites list - SOLVED! :) - to pass in the entire object into the function, check using mal_id

### Acknowledgements

Jikan API for the amazing documentation. This has made building the project so much easier.

As an anime fan, this project is a dream project of mine, to create my own take of MyAnimeList with the programming skills I have learnt so far. Even though there might be some unsolved issues, I am really proud of this project!
